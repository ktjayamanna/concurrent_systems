"""
Simple approach, directly communicating with an LLM, listing the
available actions in the system prompt (first message) along some explanation, and asking
the LLM in a loop until it thinks the user's request is fulfilled, parsing the LLM's
response for action invocations in JSON format and calling those along the way.
Works for both, GPT and vLLM.
Parameter "ask_policy" can be used to determine how much confirmation the LLM will require.
